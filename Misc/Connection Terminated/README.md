Hint: Make sure to turn on your satellite

The necesaary information we need from here is location that uses 3 words and RIT news antenna.

Googling `RIT news antenna` gives an [article](https://hackaday.com/2023/03/23/enormous-metal-sculpture-becomes-an-antenna/) about some students from RIT that made a metal statue called Sentinel to transmit radio. 

Googling `location that uses 3 words` gives us a service called [what3words](https://what3words.com/) which gives a location with 3 words.

So looking up the exact location of Sentinel gives us the flag.
